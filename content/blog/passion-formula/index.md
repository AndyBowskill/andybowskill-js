I was aimlessly looking for a side-project that held my attention. One day, I watched Tom Bilyeu (who hosts the YouTube channel [Impact Theory](https://www.youtube.com/c/TomBilyeu "Impact Theory")) explaining his passion formula. Simply put, it’s this:

> **Interest/Fascination + Mastery**

Interest/Fascination for me. Well, I adore reading fantasy in my spare time.
Mastery for me. I’ve tried a lot of programming languages, but I love JavaScript (consequentially React and Jest) at the moment. But, mastery of any programming language takes time and dedication.

What’s your interest or fascination? What’s your programming languages of choice? Do you regard yourself to be master of that?

- Is it a person who loves the outdoors in nature and Swift?
- Is it a person who loves Arduino and Rust?
- Is it a person who loves Koi Carp and Python?

Somewhere, a passion side-project is out there waiting for you.
