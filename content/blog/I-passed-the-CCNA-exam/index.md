I passed the CCNA 200-301 exam on the first attempt. I was putting it off for a couple of weeks because I needed to practice more hands-on and reread the official Cisco books. But I realised I would never be prepared, so I took the CCNA exam regardless. My thoughts about the CCNA experience as a whole:

I purchased official CCNA 200-301 volumes 1 and 2 books by Wendell Odom and started from there. The books are dry and dense, but the quality of information is second to none.

I bought Jeremy's IT Labs online training accompanying the Cisco CCNA books I mentioned a minute ago. Jeremy is a great teacher and his Anki flashcards for CCNA are helpful. His slides were not enough to engage me, though. The plus point is the up-front cost. I think it's too cheap for the information he presents!
Another excellent online training is CBT Nuggets. All of the presenters are engaging and full of real-world knowledge. But the per-month subscription is too much for some people.

If you are learning by doing mentality, Cisco Packet Tracer is a must. It's free (after you sign up for the Cisco Networking Academy), and in my humble opinion, it's more than enough practice for the CCNA. For example, I used Cisco Packet Tracer to reinforce my understanding of OSPF routing protocol, IPv6 and WLC (Wireless LAN Controllers).

The final point is I took the exam online at home via Pearson VUE. No qualms whatsoever about the experience.
