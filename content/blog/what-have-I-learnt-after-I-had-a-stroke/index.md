Five years ago, I had a stroke when I was 35 years old. It was a freak accident playing bubble football for my cousin’s stag weekend. At the time, I was a senior developer, and I led 3 Scrum teams for any technical queries and advice. I worked hard, but I quite liked the pace. Countless hours flew by when I worked and connected with my fellow colleagues. I worked from 8:00 until 19:00 frequently. Occasionally, I worked throughout my lunch hour too. Well, not only work, but also I enjoyed as a hobby.

Some of the things I realised after the stroke (obviously it’s my opinion only):

**Family first, work second.**

I favoured work over family. I have swapped it around now. My first priority is my family. My second priority is software development. Everything else is a lower priority.

**Time is the most precious resource you have.**

I have fond memories at work in my thirties, but the time flew by. It was a blur, honestly.

**Money is a tool.**

More money equals more expensive clothes, cars and gadgets. Some say it’s a vicious circle.

**Technology is constantly changing.**

Programming languages and technology, as a whole, are constantly changing. It would help if you were a learner mindset to keep up-to-date regularly. Be cautious, though; you have to stop somewhere because you will be insane otherwise.
 
**Physical books about software development are out-of-date straightaway.**

Physical books about frameworks, concepts and programming languages are out-of-date straightaway, sadly. I prefer to go to YouTube or an official website for up-to-date documentation.
For example, Facebook’s React has an excellent website detailing React and the guidelines for that as well. The official website is [here](https://reactjs.org/). On YouTube, Leigh Halliday is an expert with React and Leigh’s videos are [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/leighhalliday).

**We are replaceable at work.**

I thought, naively, I was special helping other developers when they were stuck and generating good code and unit test practices. Don’t get me wrong, though. I had the purpose of empowering and training other developers and writing internal blogs about unit tests and code coverage. But I thought I was special because I worked harder than everyone else. I’m embarrassed to say that’s not true in the slightest!

I still love programming and problem solving, but I relax in the evenings, and my stress levels are below average. Now, I have a balance between work and me-time.
